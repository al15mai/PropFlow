# Add residents association tax a utility type
# Utilities cost breakdown from landlord dashboard doesn't include all types and it seems a bit crowded (it's always for all properites and a bit small idk)... same goes for Business performance... try to improve these two views
# View History from properties doesn't do anything in the popup
# in tenants tab in the table view contract/lease period "2023-01-01 | 2024-01-01" is displayed weird when the page is smaller (the text wraps in rows but dates are split (they shouldn't, try making a small container with 2 rows"
# landlord settings page has white text on white background in all fields
